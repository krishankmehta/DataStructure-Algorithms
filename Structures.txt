Using primitive data type we deifne a structure which is a user data type
struct Rectangle
{
int length;            --------2 Bytes
int breadth;	       --------2 Bytes
}; 
Above is just the defination. Total 4 bytes, still there is no size unless you declare a variable



int main()
{
struct Rectangle r; declaration
struct Rectangle r = {10,5}; initialization
r.length = 10;
r.breadth  15;
}
If its in main it will be in the stack frame

struct Rectangle r[10];  ------This is array of structures
r[0].length ----------- How to access the element
